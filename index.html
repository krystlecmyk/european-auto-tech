Ben and his staff treated me with complete respect, and professionalism. You can beat that when taking your car to Ben he will not only give you the best price, but he will treat your car like it was his own. Would not trust anyone but European Auto when it comes to your vehicle! I give it five stars! Love you guys :) Thank you Helen."</p>

                        <p class="review-text">"Had a Check Engine light come on Thursday morning (it was 1deg.F out) so my first call was to Ben at European Auto Tech. Told me to bring it in same day and he would check it out with his factory BMW diagnostic computer. Turned out to be a misfire on cylinders 1,4 and 7. Felt it was due to the extreme cold weather and potential condensation. Since I have 75k miles on the plugs, we ordered new plugs, which were in the next day, and plan to replace them as preventative maintenance. Could be coil packs as well but Ben suggested starting with the simpleist, least expensive components first and see what happens. I appreciated his approach and common sense course of action, all with no pressure to throw money and parts at the problem. I recommend European Auto Tech with complete confidence...... "</p>

In credit to his character, he offered to assist a non BMW shop, by walking them through specific procedures in order to get me on the road again, after an accident while out of state with no BMW repair shop for miles. I also like that he takes the time to meet with me after working on my X5, to review what has been done with regard to any concerns that I had. You do not get this type of service/explanation at a dealership. I highly recommend European Auto Tech to anyone especially those that are particular about their cars."</p>

His meticulous attention to detail, high quality of repair and personalized service are attributes not easily found these days. His broad depth of experience, current diagnostic equipment and tooling, as well as Ben's innate ability to find and fix it right the first time, your down time is minimal. You always seem to get more than you expect, for less than you would expect, at European Auto Tech. The modern, clean and customer friendly facilities welcome both you and your vehicle. The nice quiet customer lounge offers complimentary beverages, WiFi, TV and comfortable couches so you can both relax or continue your business. The entire experience is much more like visiting a trusted family friend than a dreaded visit to the shop. For these reasons, and many more, I highly recommend European Auto Tech."</p>

We have nothing against the MINI dealer in Omaha, but when you live in Lincoln, it's a lot of work to get up there. I feel that European Auto Tech did a good job of explaining what was needed, and scheduled the work quickly. I have no idea of a price comparison for this same work with the dealer, but would imagine this shop is less pricey. Friendly, knowledgeable people, and they  have a real common sense approach to service. We will be back!"</p>

						<p class="review-text">"These guys really helped me out of a jam! I was visiting Lincoln all the way from Seattle and our Audi Q7 tdi threw engine codes and went into limp mode. The closest Audi dealer in Omaha was not even answering the phone. We got lucky finding European Autorech just a few miles away from our hotel. They agreed to see us that day and a couple hours later we were back on the road. We really appreciated the fast, friendly and spot on repair. Would definitely recommended them."</p>

In less then a hour I had a new coil on my car and was able to enjoy my weekend out of town. I would recommend them for anyone looking for a honest shop that puts the customer needs first!!"</p>
